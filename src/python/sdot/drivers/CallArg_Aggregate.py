    """Default lowering of an aggregate instance: one child `CallArg` per declared field.

    Reached when a type provides no `make_CallArg` of its own (a plain `@aggregate`). A field
    whose type is itself an `@aggregate` lands here too: aggregates nest. A field that is a
    mere declaration (an `Axis`) lowers to nothing and is skipped.

    In C++ the aggregate becomes a *template* named after the Python class (`type_name`), one
    definition per class, and each member is exactly ONE type parameter:

        template<class T_vertex_positions, class T_nb_vertices, class T_nb_dims>
        struct Cell { T_vertex_positions vertex_positions; ... };

        auto cell = Cell{ tensor_view( ... ), make_shape_var_view( ... ), Ct<SI,2>{} };

    So *what a member is* is decided per call -- a `TensorView`, a `NoneTensor` when the
    attribute is unbound, a `ZeroTensor` when it is symbolically zero -- while the definition
    stays one template. The same `Cell` can then appear twice in a call with `dim = 2` and
    `dim = 3`, or with one of its tensors bound and the other not, and the C++ body still reads
    a member's scalar type, rank, axis names or compile-time value straight off its type.

    We never SPELL an instantiation, though: C++20 deduces it from the members we build it with
    (aggregate CTAD), here and inside `make_available` -- where the deduced type differs anyway,
    the kernel's views living in another memory space. A nested aggregate is no exception: it is
    one type parameter too, deduced in turn from its own members. Nothing is forwarded, prefixed,
    or written twice.

    What the struct does NOT hold is io: which members a kernel reads and which it writes is a
    property of that `run_parallel`, not of the data -- chain two kernels over one `Cell` and the
    answer changes. So a second template is generated beside it, the io POLICY (`Cell_io`): the
    same shape, holding a category per member. It is passed where `run_parallel` already expects
    a category, and the struct reads its own members out of it (`io_of_<member>`); a plain tag
    (`InpList()`) still works and then holds for every member. Python emits the policy THIS call
    implies as `<arg>_io` -- a default the body may ignore.
