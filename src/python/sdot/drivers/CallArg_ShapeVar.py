    """A `ShapeVar` crossing the FFI: a buffer of `std::int32_t` COUNTS, plus a `max` bound.

    The count is a device value -- read by the kernel when the var has one, written by it when
    the var is an output. It is rank 0 for a plain count, rank > 0 for a ragged one (one count
    per segment, along its `dep_axes`). A rank-0 count is still bound as a 1-element buffer
    (xla FFI rank-0 buffers are avoided), viewed as a rank-0 `TensorView` over its pointer.

    What the count is NOT is a size: what sizes the buffers depending on this var is its
    CAPACITY, a decision made by the CALL (see `CallArgsAnalysis`). It crosses as the `max`
    bound of the `ShapeVarView`, so a written count can be capacity-checked on the C++ side --
    and a count that does not fit is recorded in the call's ERROR BUFFER, under the `error_id`
    given here, for the host to reserve more and run again.

    An unbound var wraps a `NoneTensor` instead of a view: there is no count anywhere, and the
    type says so -- writing it does not compile, rather than corrupting a null pointer.
