class CallArgsAnalysis:
    """Lower the kwargs of `driver.call` into a tree of `CallArg`.

    The objects are built by the CALLER (`cell = Cell( nb_dims = 2 )`); this class never
    constructs anything. It walks them and says how each attribute reaches the kernel: which
    buffers to bind and in what order, what C++ struct to emit, what to allocate, and where the
    results go back. Prescribing and sharing belong to the aggregate's constructor, not here.

    Dispatch carries no type knowledge: an attribute is asked to lower ITSELF via `make_CallArg`
    (`Tensor`, `ShapeVar` and `CtShapeVar` each answer differently; an `Axis` answers `None` --
    it is a declaration, not data). An object that does not know how (a plain `@aggregate`)
    falls back to the default: walk its fields as a `CallArg_Aggregate`.

    `path` is the dotted attribute path from the call kwarg (`"cell.vertex_positions"`): it is
    what `output_attributes` and `capacities` name, and naming an aggregate covers everything
    below it.

    CAPACITIES live here, and nowhere else. Sizing an output is a decision about ONE allocation
    -- so it is a parameter of the call, not state on the object (which would let an object
    claim a capacity of 64 while holding a buffer of 8). `capacity_of` resolves one, in order:

    1. what this call was given (`capacities = { "cell.nb_vertices": 8 }`);
    2. else what is ALREADY ALLOCATED for that var, read off the buffers of the tensors that
       use it -- a fact, not a decision, so a chained call need not restate it;
    3. else a count Python actually holds (a `CtShapeVar`, a prescribed value);
    4. else there is nothing to allocate from, and we say which attribute is missing.

    The DEVICE is here too: it is not a runtime parameter of the kernel but part of the type of
    everything the kernel touches (a buffer's memory space is in its `TensorView` type), so every
    node needs it while it emits its C++.
