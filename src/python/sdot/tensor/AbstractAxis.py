    `offset`, plus the single-variable inversion used to solve a `ShapeVar`
    from an observed size.

    whose names an aggregate resolves) or, outside of any aggregate, as the
    `ShapeVar` itself (`Axis( nb_dims )`).

    They differ in what is known at declaration time (virtual `register_in`):
    an `Axis` is a single dimension (ragged when one of its `ShapeVar`s has
    rank > 0); an `AxisList` is a *family* of dimensions to be unrolled, whose
    count (`nb_dims`) is unknown when the class is declared.
