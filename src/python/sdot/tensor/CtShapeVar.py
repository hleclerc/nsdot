    Emitted as a compile-time constant (a literal `static constexpr`) in the generated source
    rather than crossing the FFI as a runtime buffer. Because the value is baked into the
    source, it is part of the library-name hash -- each distinct value yields a distinct
    compiled library (enabling template specialization, loop unrolling, ...).

    It must therefore be *prescribed* (`Cell( nb_dims = 2 )`), and it is the one case where
    count and capacity coincide: the value is in the type, so a buffer sized on it is sized on
    exactly what the kernel will see. Nothing to allocate for, nothing for a kernel to write.
