"""Batching an `@aggregate` over extra leading axes.

Batching is a construction-time option of EVERY aggregate, not a distinct type: `Cell` stays
`Cell`. Passing `batch_axes = [ ax, ... ]` to a constructor (e.g. `Cell.make_hypercube`) adds those
axes on the LEFT of every tensor the aggregate declares. The annotations are the "scalar" schema
and stay untouched; `__base_init__` builds each per-instance `Tensor` with the batch axes prepended
(see `util/aggregate.py`).

On the C++ side a batch is nothing but a leading, NAMED tensor dimension, which the existing kernel
machinery already threads transparently (`global_batch_indices`, `cell( batch_index )`, each member
a template parameter carrying its axis-name types). So batching lives entirely on the Python side.

A batch axis is an ordinary `Axis` over its own `ShapeVar`, whose size is PRESCRIBED (a batch extent
is known in Python, so the outputs can be allocated and displayed without a kernel writing a count).
`new_batch_axis( size )` mints a fresh, unshared one; passing the SAME axis object to several
aggregates is how they get JOINED (co-iterated) instead -- which is opt-in, never the default.
