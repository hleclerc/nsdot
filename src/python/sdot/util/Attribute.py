class Attribute:
    """Base protocol for `@aggregate` field declarations.

    This is the *only* thing `@aggregate` knows about: it operates on classes
    whose fields are `Attribute`s, with no knowledge of any concrete field type
    (`ShapeVar`, `Tensor`, ... are just examples).

    A field annotation is a `Parametrized` (`Attribute[...]`) that acts as the
    class-level *schema*. `get_attribute` calls it once per parent instance to
    build a fresh per-instance `Attribute` that holds that instance's state, kept
    in `self._attributes`. `@aggregate` installs one data descriptor per field:
    `c.field` returns `get` (the read view), `c.field = value` routes to `set`.

    The dependency stops there: an `Attribute` knows NOTHING about `@aggregate`.
    Every ctor takes the same two keyword-only channels, and an aggregate is only
    ever one possible caller:

        Attr( *args, template_args = (), template_kwargs = {}, scope = None )

    * `template_args` / `template_kwargs` are the declaration (`Attr[ ... ]`), i.e.
      what a `Parametrized` schema carries;
    * `scope` is what resolves a template arg given as a NAME (see
      `resolve_attribute`) -- an `@aggregate` instance, or `None` outside of one;
    * the POSITIONALS are the concrete type's own business (a value for `Tensor`,
      an affine expression for `Axis`, ...), which is what lets each type be built
      on its own: `Tensor( 17 )`, `Axis( nb_dims )`, `Tensor[ x, y ]( [ ... ] )`.

    `name` is the declared field name, stamped by `get_attribute`. An `Attribute`
    that outlives its aggregate keeps it (a `Tensor` built on a borrowed `Axis`
    still knows that axis is called `num_vertex`, which is what the C++ side needs
    to name it).
