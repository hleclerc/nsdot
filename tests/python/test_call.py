# An `@aggregate` instance is built BEFORE the call and passed as a plain kwarg. Inputs and
# outputs are DISJOINT (as in XLA): a kernel never writes what it reads, so there is no
# aliasing, and no reconciling of two sizes under one name. What looks like a mutation is a
# Python-side rebinding, done by the caller between two calls.
#
# Each attribute of a passed object falls in exactly one category:
#
# * named in `output_attributes` -> an OUTPUT: a fresh buffer, allocated at the capacity this
#   call decided, rebound onto the attribute once the call returns.
# * holds a value -> an INPUT, bound at the size its data actually has.
# * empty and not declared -> UNBOUND: nothing crosses the FFI, and the kernel is not handed a
#   degenerate view to test but a `NoneTensor`, a TYPE with no data (an attribute may simply be
#   optional and unused -- see `partial_init`).
#
# Nothing is returned: outputs are written back onto the instances we were given (the
# aggregate is our own Python object -- Jax only ever sees the tensors inside it).
#
# The io category is not just bookkeeping: it is what `make_available` uses to move a member to
# the device and back. It is a property of the KERNEL, though, not of the data -- chain two
# kernels over one object and they may read and write different parts of it. So the generated
# struct holds none: it is handed a POLICY (`Cell_io`, the same shape, one category per member)
# where `run_parallel` expects a category. This call's own policy comes ready-made as
# `<arg>_io`, but a body may hand another one -- or a plain tag, which then holds for every
# member (`InpList(), cell`). A bare tensor has no members, so a plain tag is all it takes.
#
# A `ShapeVar` holds a COUNT: how many items are used. A kernel reads it or writes it, so it
# lives in a device buffer; under `jit` Python does not know it, and it can therefore never
# size anything (an XLA shape cannot depend on a device value).
#
# What sizes a buffer is a CAPACITY -- and a capacity is NOT state on the object: it is a
# decision about ONE allocation, so it is given to the CALL that allocates. An object only
# ever says what it IS; the call says what it allocates. A capacity already materialized in a
# buffer is read back from it, so a chained call need not restate it.
